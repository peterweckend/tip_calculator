# tip_calculator
~~http://peterweckend.com/tipcalc.html~~

Made to help practice jQuery and JavaScript. Calculates tips and totals. Includes input validation, automatically added units, and the ability to split the bill with other people.

Future ideas: add chart that shows similar tip percentage amounts (ex: enter 17% tip and get additional values 15% or 20% tip as well), ability to enter venue and have calculator suggest tip amounts
